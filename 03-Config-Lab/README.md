As we can see there is an alarm raised. This alarm states that there is an EC2 instance that does not have "Detailed Monitoring" Enabled. Letâ€™s proceed and remediate this
alarm.

9)  Lets click on the alarm and see what EC2 instance does not comply with our configuration rule. Take note of the instance ID so we can remediate this alarm.

10)  Now that we have the EC2 instance that is not compliant let's go and enable the "Detaied Monitoring". Go to the *EC2 console* and under __Instances__ search for the 
instance ID that has the alarm.
